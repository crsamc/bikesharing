# NYC_Citibike_Challenge
## Overview
For this analysis, use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, create a set of visualizations to:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
- Finally, add these new visualizations to the two created in this module for the final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

This chart shows the peak riding hours during August in NYC. Based on the chart, the top riding hours are from 5pm-7pm. The suggested maintenance would be 2am-5am because those times having the lowest amount of rides.

This breaks down the duration of rides based on gender. It reiterates that most rides are taken by males.

This heatmap shows the usage pattern of riders. You see heavy usage on the weekdays between 5-7pm, as well as, weekday mornings between 7-9am. I would assume that would be during commute to and from jobs, etc. However, Wednesday evenings don't meet the standard high activity as the other days. There is also more activity throughout the daytime hours on weekends.

As a follow up to the heatmap above. This map shows the same level of high usage during the commute to and from. It also ties in the fact that males are using the bikes at a higher number than female or unknown users.

Lastly, this heatmap too shows that most riders are subscribing males.

## Summary
In conclusion, bikeshare services are highly utilized and needed in large metropolitan areas. The user base is made up mostly of male subscribers. The main usage seems focused around morning and evening commute times during the week.

Additional visualizations suggested for future analysis based on the given data:

1. Trip starting and ending locations during morning and evening rush hour timeframes.
2. The average trip duration, by birth year and gender, to see if there was any difference in male, female or unknown gender riders as they age.
